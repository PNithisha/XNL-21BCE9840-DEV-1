XNL-21BCE9840-DEV-1 
Fully Automated, Multi-Cloud DevOps Ecosystem with Kubernetes, Blockchain, and AI-based Orchestration 



Project Overview
This project focuses on a fully automated, self-healing, multi-cloud DevOps ecosystem with the following key features:  

Multi-Cloud Infrastructure Deployment** (AWS, Azure, GCP) using Terraform & Kubernetes
AI-Based Kubernetes Orchestration** with **Prometheus + Grafana Monitoring
Advanced Cybersecurity** with **automated security testing 
Blockchain-Powered CI/CD Pipeline** (Hyperledger Fabric / Ethereum)  
End-to-End Automation** using **Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Docker 

This repository includes the Terraform scripts, Kubernetes manifests, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring configurations, security test scripts, blockchain smart contracts, and detailed documentation to set up the entire system.

Deployment Guide  

 Clone the Repository 

git clone https://github.com/PNithisha/XNL-21BCE9840-DEV-1.git
cd XNL-21BCE9840-DEV-1

 Setup Terraform for Multi-Cloud Infrastructure

cd infrastructure
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

 This will deploy servers on AWS, Azure, and GCP automatically.  

Deploy the Application to Kubernetes 

kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/

This will create Pods, Deployments, and Services in Kubernetes.  

 Set Up Monitoring (Grafana & Prometheus) 

kubectl apply -f monitoring/prometheus.yml
kubectl apply -f monitoring/grafana.yml

 Access Grafana Dashboard at http://<your-k8s-ip>:3000  

 Run Security Tests

cd security
bash security-scan.sh

Nmap Port Scanning & OWASP Security Tests 



CI/CD Pipeline Workflows 

 GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/ci-cd-pipeline.yml) 
 Triggers on Code Push
 Builds Docker Image
  Pushes to DockerHub
  Deploys to Kubernetes  

 Jenkins Pipeline (ci-cd/Jenkinsfile) 
Pulls Code from GitHub
Runs Unit & Security Tests
Builds and Pushes Docker Image
Deploys to Kubernetes 



Blockchain Integration 
A Hyperledger Fabric / Ethereum Smart Contract** is used to secure CI/CD logs and verify integrity. 

Smart Contract Location: blockchain/smart-contract.sol 
Deployment Guide: 

cd blockchain
truffle migrate --network rinkeby

Ethereum Contract Verification: 
solidity
function isCertified(address user) public view returns (bool);




Monitoring Dashboard (Grafana + Prometheus)
Grafana URL: http://<your-k8s-ip>:3000 
Prometheus URL:http://<your-k8s-ip>:9090`  
Monitors System Health, Container Logs, and Security Events.  



Security Testing 
Automated Security Scans are performed using 
Nmap→ Scans open ports  
OWASP ZAP → Detects security vulnerabilities  
SonarQube → Analyzes code quality  

Run Security Tests Manually

cd security
bash security-scan.sh

Results stored in security/logs/



Performance Testing
Performance tests are done using JMeter.  
Test Plan Location:testing/load-test.jmx 
Run JMeter Load Test:
bash
jmeter -n -t testing/load-test.jmx -l test-results.jtl
